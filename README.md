### **Hey there!** 👋

I'm [Kaouther](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kaouther-bensaddek-7434162b8/), an AI student from Algeria

I build things that mix intelligence, design, and real impact.

My main tech stack is Python, C, C++, Java, TypeScript, and PHP and I enjoy exploring AI, algorithms, and data analysis. My favorite tools are Figma, VS Code, GitHub, and Notion.

I collaborate in teams on three main school projects in Mobile Development, Software Engineering, and Data mining.

My favorite project so far is Eventy, which connects event organizers with people hosting events.  

**Fun Facts:**

<!-- - Planning Manager at **ETC club** 💙 -->
- I love purple 💜
- I don’t function well without planning everything  
- I love anime, design, and building things that look aesthetic  
- I strongly believe any boring idea can become cool with good UI
