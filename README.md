# ✨ Hey there! [Cute Wave](https://media.giphy.com/media/xT0xeJpnrWC4XWblEk/giphy.gif)

I'm **Kaouther**, an AI student from Algeria
I turn ideas into experiments, experiments into projects, and projects into things people can actually use.  


My main tech stack is **Python, C, C++, Java, TypeScript, and PHP**.  
I also enjoy exploring **AI, algorithms, and data analysis**.
My favorite tools are **Figma, VS Code, GitHub, and Notion**.  



I collaborate in teams on three main school projects in Mobile Development, Software Engineering, and AI/algorithms.
My favorite project so far is **Eventy**, which connects **event organizers with people hosting events**.
