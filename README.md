**Hey there!** 👋

I'm <u>Kaouther</u>, an AI student from Algeria.  

I turn ideas → experiments → projects → things people can actually use.  

💻 **Tech Stack:** Python | C | C++ | Java | TypeScript | PHP  
🤖 **Interests:** AI, algorithms, data analysis  
🛠️ **Favorite Tools:** Figma | VS Code | GitHub | Notion  

I collaborate in teams on **three main school projects**: Mobile Development, Software Engineering, and AI/algorithms.  

My favorite project so far: **Eventy** connecting event organizers with people hosting events.  

**Fun Facts:**  
- I don’t function well without planning everything  
- I love anime, design, and building things that look ✨aesthetic✨  
- I strongly believe any boring idea can become cool with good UI
